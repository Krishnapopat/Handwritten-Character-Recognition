# Handwritten-Character-Recognition

This contains Handwritten Character Recognition using the MNIST and the EMNIST dataset.
Here we have used KNN,ANN,CNN for the same and we have also implemented ANN and KNN from Scracth(Without libraries)
and at last conclusion was that CNN gives the best accuracy.
